Pomodoro timer + music. Inspired by Carl Franklin's ["Music To Code By"](http://mtcb.pwop.com/) (and basically built because I wanted a player that would stop and let me know to take a break at the end of each track).

Contributions/suggestions/commentary are welcome. This is just a fun little project that I felt like doing.

Current platform is WPF, but planned platforms include:

* UWP
* Android (via Xamarin)
* iOS (via Xamarin)

I may even go nuts and do a version of this using Electron or NativeScript.

__Notes on Music__

This app assumes that each track is the full length of the pomodoro, so it currently prompts you to take a break at the end of each song. _Music To Code By_ is the work of Carl Franklin and it is up to you to purchase/download the tracks (or any other tracks that are a good pomodoro length) and point this at them.
