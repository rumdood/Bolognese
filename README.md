Pomodoro timer + music. Inspired by Carl Franklin's ["Music To Code By"](http://mtcb.pwop.com/) (and basically built because I wanted a player that would stop and let me know to take a break at the end of each track).

This was also a way for me to play around with ["Caliburn.Micro"](http://caliburnmicro.com/) and WPF, which I hadn't done much of before. Current plans include an Electron-based version as well (likely built with ["Aurelia"](http://aurelia.io/) because Rob Eisenberg's frameworks are just awesome, and I'm considering potential VS plugin and a Xamarin rework.

Contributions/suggestions/commentary are welcome. This is just a fun little project that I felt like doing.
